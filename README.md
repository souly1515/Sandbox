# Sandbox
Custom engine for me to do random things with
## Features
### Vulkan engine
Rendering uses Vulkan
### Shader builder
This external program will act as a shader compiler that searches a folder and compiles all shaders in them.
Creates c++ interface that should link to the engine
## Todo
Handle shader builder's output properly cause its currently messed up by multiple processes outputing error messages at the same time
