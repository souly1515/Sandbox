# Sandbox
Custom engine for me to do random things with
## Features
### Vulkan engine
Rendering uses Vulkan
### Shader builder
This external program will act as a shader compiler that searches a folder and compiles all shaders in them.
Creates c++ interface that should link to the engine

## Todo
textures
compute shaders
more sophisticated descriptor management system
	management of descriptors via external file with autogenerated bind points etc
gpu mem manager
thread system
	tracy locks

Handle resource management with allocation
Graphics scheduler
    alias resources

## Known Issues
shader builder's output gets messed up if multiple shader compilation processes outputs error messages at the same time
