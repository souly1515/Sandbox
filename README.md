# Sandbox
Custom engine for me to do random things with
## Features
### Vulkan engine
Rendering uses Vulkan
### Shader builder
This external program will act as a shader compiler that searches a folder and compiles all shaders in them.
Creates c++ interface that should link to the engine
## Todo
Setup hashes for pipeline state manager
Actually test pipeline state manager
## Known Issues
shader builder's output gets messed up if multiple shader compilation processes outputs error messages at the same time
